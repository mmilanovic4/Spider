# Overview

Educational, open-source and multi-threaded website crawler written in Python, inspired by [thenewboston](https://github.com/buckyroberts/Spider). It looks for internal links only - subdomains are excluded. However, this and number of threads could be tweaked easily.

## Usage

Simply run **spider.py** using Python 3.x. You will also need to have **beautifulsoup4** module installed. Script takes target URL as a required argument:
`python3 spider.py https://xkcd.com`
